I. INTRODUCTION

THE healthcare industry is undergoing rapid digital transformation, with an increasing emphasis on patient-centered care and accessibility of healthcare services. Traditional healthcare delivery models often face challenges related to information fragmentation, limited accessibility, and inefficient communication between healthcare providers and patients [1]. These challenges have been further highlighted during global health crises, emphasizing the need for robust digital healthcare solutions.

The FirstLight Hospital Management System addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive web-based platform that integrates various aspects of healthcare management into a unified system. The system aims to enhance patient engagement, improve healthcare delivery efficiency, and provide seamless access to healthcare services through a user-friendly interface.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the FirstLight Hospital Management System, focusing on its architecture, key features, security implementations, and potential for future enhancements. The system represents a significant step toward the digitalization of healthcare services, aligning with the global trend of healthcare digital transformation.

II. RELATED WORK

Several studies have explored the development and implementation of healthcare management systems. Alotaibi and Federico [2] discussed the impact of health information technology on patient safety, highlighting the importance of well-designed systems in reducing medical errors. Similarly, Kruse et al. [3] conducted a systematic review of electronic health record implementations, identifying key success factors and barriers.

Commercial healthcare management systems like Epic, Cerner, and Meditech have dominated the market, offering comprehensive solutions for large healthcare organizations [4]. However, these systems often require significant resources for implementation and maintenance, making them less accessible for smaller healthcare providers.

Open-source healthcare management systems like OpenEMR and OpenMRS have emerged as alternatives, providing customizable solutions with lower implementation costs [5]. These systems, however, often require technical expertise for customization and maintenance.

The FirstLight Hospital Management System builds upon these existing solutions, focusing on user-centered design, accessibility, and integration of various healthcare services in a single platform. The system incorporates modern web technologies to provide a responsive and intuitive user interface, addressing the limitations of existing systems.
